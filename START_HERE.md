## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Form submits but no email received:

**Check 1:** Environment variables
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard, verify all 3 variables are set:
RESEND_API_KEY, EMAIL_FROM, EMAIL_TO
```

**Check 2:** Spam folder
Look in spam/junk folder of EMAIL_TO address

**Check 3:** Vercel function logs
```bash
# View logs
npx vercel logs --follow

# Or in Vercel dashboard:
Project → Functions → api/submit-contact.js → Logs
```

**Check 4:** Resend dashboard
Go to https://resend.com/emails to see delivery status

---

### "Method not allowed" error:

**Solution:** Redeploy
```bash
cd /c/users/akhil/hss-website
npx vercel --prod
```

---

### Console errors in browser:

**Solution:** Open DevTools (F12)
1. Go to Console tab
2. Look for specific error message
3. Check Network tab for `/api/submit-contact` request
4. View response
